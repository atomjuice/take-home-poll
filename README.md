# Atomjuice Take Home Poll
The Atomjuice Take Home Poll application is a standard Django application created using the Django admin tool, 
see [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for more information on how to get the project started.

## Project Overview
The project is an incomplete short mock programmer survey that is intended to act similarly to a Google Form, which 
asks a few questions and should save the responses to be displayed on a subsequent page.

## Project Brief
As a user of the application I want to collect the answers from the participants so that I can assess them independently.

As a participant I need to be able to submit my answers and view the current results of the entire survey on a 
subsequent page.

If you have any ideas to expand upon the brief, please feel free to implement them, but please also make sure you meet
the brief first.

We expect that completing the outstanding work for this project should take roughly 3 hours, this is not a hard limit
and is just a rough guideline. However the deadline will be a week from when you are provided with the take home 
assessment to ensure that you are given enough time despite any other potential commitments.

We will be looking for a good understanding of the problem and a reasonable solution. We will be assessing the quality
of the code submitted ensuring that it is easy to read, understand, maintain and would be ready for a production 
environment.

Please reach out if you have any clarification questions.
